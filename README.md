## ALGORITHM:
### a. Applying Gestalt Principles to Medi-Scan 
       i) Gestalt principles describe how the human brain perceives visuals. For an accessibility app, these are crucial:
       ii) Proximity: Group related info together. Keep the "Medicine Name" and "Dosage" in one card so the user knows they are related.
       iii) Similarity: Use the same shape for all "Warning" buttons and another shape for "Action" buttons so the user recognizes their function instantly.
       iv) Common Region: Place the scan results inside a distinct container or card. This separates the "Result" from the background "Home" elements.

### b. Incorporating UI Elements & Design Pattern
       i) For a hackathon, don't reinvent the wheel. Use established patterns:<br>
       ii) The "Floating Action Button" (FAB): Place a large, circular "Scan" button at the bottom center of the home screen. This is a standard Android pattern that users recognize.<br>
       iii) Card UI: Use cards with soft shadows to display information. It makes the text "pop" and easier to read for elderly users.
       iv) Progress Indicators: Use a linear or circular loader while the OCR (text scanning) is processing. This tells the user, "Wait, I’m thinking."

### c. Interaction Behaviors & Usability Principles
       i) This is where you win "UX points." Focus on Fitts's Law and Error Prevention:
       ii) Fitts's Law: Make the most important buttons (Scan, Play Audio) large and easy to hit. Small buttons are a nightmare for seniors.
      iii) Haptic Feedback: When the scan is successful, the phone should vibrate slightly. This provides a non-visual confirmation.
      iv) Visibility of System Status: If the camera can't see the text clearly, show a message: "Move closer" or "Turn on lights."
      v) Minimalism: Only show one primary action per screen to avoid "Cognitive Overload."

### d. Branding: Creating a Logo in Canva
     i) Since you need to move fast, follow these branding guidelines for your Medi-Scan logo:
     ii) Iconography: Use a combination of a Magnifying Glass and a Pill or a Cross.
     Color Palette:
    iii) Primary: Royal Blue (#0052CC) – Represents trust and health.
     iv) Accent: White or Light Teal – Represents cleanliness and clarity.
     v) Typography: Choose a bold, clean Sans-Serif font like Montserrat or Open Sans in Canva. Avoid "fancy" or "script" fonts.
     vi) Canva Hack: Search for "Medical Logo" templates, then simplify them. Remove extra lines and make the icon bold.

Logo Tip: Ensure your logo has a "Transparent Background" version so you can place it neatly on your Splash screen and in your Figma design.

## LOGO:
<img width="563" height="580" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af83b566-b412-4573-a26b-3d809a75361d" />
